//    * This method is called immediately prior to socket:didAcceptNewSocket:.
//    * It optionally allows a listening socket to specify the socketQueue for a new accepted socket.
//    * If this method is not implemented, or returns NULL, the new accepted socket will create its own default queue.
//    *
//    * Since you cannot autorelease a dispatch_queue,
//    * this method uses the "new" prefix in its name to specify that the returned queue has been retained.
//    *
//    * Thus you could do something like this in the implementation:
//    * return dispatch_queue_create("MyQueue", NULL);
//    *
//    * If you are placing multiple sockets on the same queue,
//    * then care should be taken to increment the retain count each time this method is invoked.
//    *
//    * For example, your implementation might look something like this:
//    * dispatch_retain(myExistingQueue);
//    * return myExistingQueue;
